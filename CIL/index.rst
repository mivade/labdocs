Theoretical overview
====================

Consider a linear Paul trap configuration as depicted in the figure
below. With voltages :math:`\pm [U + V \cos(\Omega)]/2` applied to
opposite pairs of electrodes, the Mathieu stability parameters are
then

.. math::
   :label: MathieuStability

   q &= \frac{2ZeV}{mr_0^2 \Omega^2} \\
   a &= \frac{4ZeU}{mr_0^2 \Omega^2}

where :math:`\Omega` is the RF (angular) frequency, :math:`r_0` is the
trap radius, and :math:`Ze` (:math:`m`) is the ion charge (mass).

   **Figure:** Generic linear Paul trap configuration. Red and blue
   electrodes have opposite RF phase for radial confinement while
   green electrodes represent DC end caps for axial confinement.

The first region of stability is depicted below. Ions falling in the
shaded region have stable orbits and are thus trapped.
